Camera Keys is an Omniverse Python extension to move the camera around, and set all 6 camera keyframes at the current frame (Transform X,y,z and Rotate x,y,z).

The extension is designed to help you easiily create camera fly throughs. Move your camera into position either manually, or using the buttons shown above and the transoform keys are set at the current frame.

# A few known issues / features I want to fix.

I would like to have Drone like controls for forward, backward, left and right transform and rotate buttons. So far I have not figured out rotation yet.

I have not figured out image buttons, but this goes with the drone like controls issue above.

Sometimes when you make a turn to the left for example, the camera will spin the wrong direction and go the long way. Not sure how to fix this yet.

I will update this read me with more information once I get some questions answered.
