Camera Keys is an Omniverse Python extension to move the camera around, and set all 6 camera keyframes at the current frame (Transform x,y,z and Rotation x,y,z).

To use this extension, you must have a camera named Camera at '/World/Camera'. Future versions may work with multiple cameras.

The extension is designed to help you easiily create camera fly throughs. Move your camera into position either manually, or using the buttons shown above and the transoform keys are set at the current frame.

Thanks to @mati-codes for writing the camera move forward and helping me with many questions. 

Change the frame in the timeline to the desired frame, then move the camera into place and click 'Set Keys' to set the keyframes.

Use the slider amounts for rotation and movement amount to set how far the camera will move on any of the button clicks.
